*Reduced Thickness Event-by-event Nuclear Topology*

This is a forked development version of `trento <https://github.com/Duke-QCD/trento>`_, an initial condition model for high-energy nuclear collisions. It includes two new parameters to vary the size and shape of the nucleon:

1. a constituent number parameter `-m [ --constituent-number ] INT (=1)`, and
2. a constituent width parameter `-v [ --constituent-width ] FLOAT (=off)`.
